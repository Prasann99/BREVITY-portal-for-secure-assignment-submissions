# BREVITY-portal-for-secure-assignment-submissions
BREVITY is a portal designed for online assignment submission where the assignment goes through  three security or validation checks which include the PLAGIARISM check, ASSESMENT using the keyword checking algorithm where we get the total matching keyword from the array to the total words in the file and third is the AUTHENTICATION check where we retrive the header info of the student or submittiee from which we get the INETAddresss  of the user and we believe that the IP of every server should be unique and hence by taking the three parameters into consideration the faculty concerned  can accept or reject the assignment and give the marks accordingly.
